      <p id="myP"> Nick Staskauskas made this. Its a website that you can go through
         using a computer which is a piece of technology that was probably
          invented before you were born. You can use a mouse to operate the
           website but not a keyboard to operate the controls, if you do not
           have a keyboard please use the mouse unless you have a keyboard in
           which case use the mouse.</p>
